Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar, in present-day Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight and became a full-time worker for the organisation in Gujarat in 1971. In 1985, he was assigned to the BJP and rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998. In 2001, Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been criticised for its management of the 2002 Gujarat riots, during which official records reported a little over 1,000 deaths, mostly Muslims, while independent estimates placed the toll at around 2,000. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him. While his policies as chief minister were credited with encouraging economic growth, his administration was also criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indicators in the state.

In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for any party since 1984. His administration increased foreign investment and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programs. Modi launched a high-profile sanitation campaign and introduced changes that weakened or abolished certain environmental and labour regulations. His demonetisation policy in 2016 and the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017 were widely debated and controversial. In 2019, his administration authorised an airstrike against a suspected terrorist training facility in Pakistan; the action carried strong nationalist appeal. Modi won re-election in 2019. In his second term, his government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, both of which prompted widespread protests and unrest. The 2020 Delhi riots resulted in violence and casualties, particularly among Muslims. Three farm laws introduced by his administration triggered major protests by farmers and were eventually repealed. Modi also led India’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the World Health Organization estimated that millions of Indians died. In the 2024 general election, Modi’s party lost its outright majority and formed a coalition government under the National Democratic Alliance. Following a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, Modi oversaw India’s involvement in the 2025 India–Pakistan conflict, which eventually resulted in a ceasefire.
